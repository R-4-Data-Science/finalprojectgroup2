Title: Multi-Path Forward Selection with AIC and Stability Analysis
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R:
    c(
      person("Cooper", "Niebuhr",email = "cwn0015@auburn.edu", role = c("aut", "cre")),
      person("Zack", "Miller", email = "zzm0028@auburn.edu", role = "aut"),

    )
Description: Provides multi-path forward selection using AIC.
    Unlike traditional stepwise regression, this procedure explores multiple
    near-optimal model paths, identifies instability via resampling-based
    selection, and filters down to models that are both AIC competitive
    and stable across bootstrap replicates.
