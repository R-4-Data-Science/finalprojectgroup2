\usage{
plausible_models(forest, stab, Delta = 2, tau = 0.6)
}
\arguments{
\item{forest}{An object of class \code{"path_forest"} produced by
\code{build_paths()} on the full data.}

\item{stab}{An object of class \code{"path_stability"} produced by
\code{stability()} on the same predictors.}

\item{Delta}{Numeric AIC tolerance \eqn{\Delta}. Models with
\code{AIC <= AIC_min + Delta} are considered close to the best model.
Typical value: \code{2}.}

\item{tau}{Numeric stability threshold \eqn{\tau} in \eqn{[0, 1]}.
Models must have average stability at least \code{tau}. Typical value:
\code{0.6}.}
}
\value{
A data frame of plausible models with one row per model and
at least the columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{model_id}, \code{step}, \code{size}, \code{aic},
\code{key}, \code{vars} (as in \code{forest$aic_by_model}).
\item \code{pi_bar}: average stability \eqn{\pi(S)} for the model.
}
Rows are sorted by \code{aic} (ascending). The returned object has
class \code{"plausible_models"}.
}
\description{
Combine the full-data multi-path search (Step 1) with stability scores
from resampling (Step 2) to obtain a set of final plausible models.
}
\details{
Following Algorithm 3 in the project description, we:
\enumerate{
\item Find the lowest AIC across all models from the full-data search.
\item Keep all models whose AIC is within \code{Delta} of this minimum.
\item For each retained model \(S\), compute its average stability
\eqn{\pi(S) = (1 / |S|) \sum_{j \in S} \pi_j}.
\item Keep only those models with \eqn{\pi(S) \ge \tau}.
}
